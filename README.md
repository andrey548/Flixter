# Flixter
Flixter is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).



## Flix Part 1

### User Stories


#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Instead of displaying movie's title and movie's descriptiong I was displaying movie's description twice. 
I displayed the description in place where title should go. Fixed by first checking Movie model and noticing that getTitle()
was never used. When I went into MovieAdapter I noticed that I used getOverview() for both the title and the overview fields.
